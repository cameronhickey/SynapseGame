200|(Alex reports from the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City.) The first artifacts museum visitors see are these architectural elements that were the signature of the World Trade Center towers; they are now known by the same name as this symbol of Poseidon|tridents
400|(Alex reports from the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City.) As The New York Times said, imagine if 9/11 had been followed by Super Storm Sandy; well, that's what would've happened if not for the slurry wall, anchored in bedrock in the 1960s to prevent the waters of this river from seeping into the foundation of the towers|the Hudson River
600|(Alex reports from the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City.) It's called "The Last Column", and it remained in the bedrock throughout the recovery process; in May 2002, it was ceremonially removed to mark the end of 9 months of work at the site known as this|Ground Zero
800|(Alex reports from the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City.) The holster belonged to David Lim, who miraculously survived in a stairwell; unfortunately, 37 of his colleagues at the PAPD, this regional agency's police department, perished|the Port Authority
1000|(Alex reports from the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City.) A brick that is not from the site still has a place here; a journalist who had covered the war on terror chiseled it from Osama bin Laden's compound before it was leveled by authorities in this Pakistan city|Abbottabad
