ODE TO A TV SHOW
200|A civil war of Ewings / In desperate bids for power / But know ye, Bobby was ne'er dead! / He was only in the shower|Dallas
400|O, life is sweet, 'tis sure / Look at this lovely meadow / Then bada bing! You're dead / Like Ralphie Cifaretto|The Sopranos
600|Sing the praises of Artie Abrams / Sing out to the sky! / For Lord knows you shan't be alone / Singing in McKinley High|Glee
800|O Boss Hogg! Thy white flannel suits / Must have had quite a cost! / But not as much as all the cars / & dignity you lost|The Dukes of Hazzard
1000|Michael Westen, Miami spy / Always knows what to do / A phony name, C-4 goes boom / & now our story's through|Burn Notice
