THE DOG WHISPERER
200|(Cesar Millan walks several large dogs) Notice that I walk ahead of the dogs; I am communicating that I'm the pack leader, the equivalent of this leader of a wild pack|the alpha
400|(Cesar Millan holds a dog.) One of the most powerful tools in working with dogs is giving rewards, what psychologists call this type of reinforcement|positive
600|(Cesar Millan stands next to a seated dog.) Dogs look to us for reassurance & notice fear immediately; in an entire city, a dog could find 1 gram of butyric acid, a component of this human secretion|sweat (or perspiration)
800|(Cesar Millan stands by a small group of dogs.) With a little bit of help from me, the pack rehabilitates unstable dogs by showing them by example how to be calm & this, the opposite of dominant or assertive in behavioral science|submissive
1000|(Cesar Millan snaps his fingers and makes a short vocal sound to a dog before giving the clue.) Operant conditioning is a fancy way of saying learning from consequences, like the simple act of correction; it is part of this school of psychology that deals with actions, not inner states, so it works well with dogs|behavioralist/behaviorism
