THE PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME
200|(Jon of the Clue Crew walks near a larger-than-life statue.) This statue brings to life one of the greatest athletes the world has known; he won gold in the 1912 Olympics & played football & baseball for New York Giants teams|Jim Thorpe
400|(Kelly of the Clue Crew indicates a photo of a Dallas Cowboys player.) At the Pro Football Hall of Fame, you can try to catch 22, but this Cowboy was so explosive, he danced his way to the NFL's all-time rushing record|Emmitt Smith
600|(Jon holds a football while delivering the clue.) Standing in the end zone, his feet almost out of bounds, the Chargers' Antonio Cromartie returned this ball an NFL-record this many yards in 2007|109 yards
800|(Jon sits in a section of red stadium seats.) These chairs are from this team's Ralph Wilson Stadium—you can almost see Jim Kelly throw & Thurman Thomas run|the Buffalo Bills
1000|(Kelly stands in front of a bust.) The only player to make it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame here in Canton, Ohio & the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in Hamilton, Ontario is this man whose name sounds like a heavenly body|Warren Moon
