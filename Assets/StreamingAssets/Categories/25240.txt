FEEDBACK: SANDWICH
200|The Connecticut, not the Maine, version of the sandwich called this roll gets my vote but why use a hot dog bun?|a lobster roll
400|I love the contrast of the banh mi's julienned veggies with this long, thin French bread, but it's essential you toast it|a baguette
600|I like the sweet marshmallow creme with savory peanut butter in this sammy, a New England fave, but don't love the texture|a fluffernutter
800|You can count on enjoying this ham, turkey & Swiss sandwich, dipped in an egg & milk mix & then fried, but must you dip it in jam?|a Monte Cristo
1000|I'm glad we've gone from paper to wafers to cookies as the "bread" for this "sandwich"; I still like the old name, hokey pokey|an ice cream sandwich
