BIOSPHERE 2
200|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew reports from Biosphere 2 at the University of Arizona.) The rainforest is key to getting feedback of tropical ecosystems and the atmosphere under climate change; in the canopy, we're using the LI-COR 6400 to measure the effectiveness of this energy process in green leaves|photosynthesis
400|(Kelly of the Clue Crew reports from Biosphere 2 at the University of Arizona.) Rain & temperature are varied to see how they impact subterranean productivity in rainforests; root observation devices give researchers new understanding of the flow of this element, atomic No. 6, in the ecosystem|carbon
600|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew reports from Biosphere 2 at the University of Arizona.) The site where the first Biospherians grew food now houses the world's biggest earth-science experiment, which will show how our land forms over time; it's called "L.E.O.", the Landscape this Observatory—Darwin would be proud|evolution
800|A million-gallon "ocean" helps test how changes affect the zoo- & phyto- types of this basis of the sea's food chain|plankton
1000|The biomes used to study biodiversity have names like desert, rainforest & this African grassland with scattered trees|the savanna
