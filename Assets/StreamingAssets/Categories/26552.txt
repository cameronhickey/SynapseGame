I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY FISH TANK
200|My tank has a buildup of blue-green algae, aka this—& not the fun, non-gross kind kids can make out of glue|slime
400|I got carried away at Petco & now my tank is overcrowded; the CDC recommends at most one inch of fish per one of these measures|gallon
600|I bought fish food that floats, but I need food that sinks to the floor of the tank; my pictus catfish is this two-word kind of eater|a bottom feeder
800|My fish are looking lethargic; I'd better test my tank water for toxic levels of NH3, this chemical compound|ammonia
1000|Uh-oh, I forgot to dechlorinate my tank water using both a sediment filter & a semipermeable membrane, via this 2-word process|reverse osmosis
