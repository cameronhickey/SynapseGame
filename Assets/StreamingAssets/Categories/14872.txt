PACIFIC OCEAN LIFE
200|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reads from the Maui Ocean Center.) To be hard to see from both above & below, many sharks have dark backs & paler bellies; this was named "counter-shading" by Abbot Thayer, an artist who helped the military develop this during World War I|camouflage
400|(Kelly of the Clue Crew reads from the Maui Ocean Center.) Mature green sea turtles are herbivores; that's why their body fat is green; young ones who haven't developed their color yet feed on creatures like jellyfish, so they're classified as these|carnivores
600|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reads from the Maui Ocean Center.) The teeth of many rays, which evolved from the scaly pieces that make up their skin, are adapted to their diet; eagle rays have flat teeth for crushing these protective structures|shells
800|(Kelly of the Clue Crew reads from the Maui Ocean Center.) Sea turtles dive to hundreds of feet by storing air in special passages; unlike the lungs, the passages don't have a network of blood vessels, so nitrogen doesn't get into the bloodstream to cause this, as in humans|the bends
1000|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reads from the Maui Ocean Center.) The distinctive head of the hammerhead shark gives the fish added lift in rising to the surface; this pair of fins that serves the same purpose is relatively underdeveloped|the pectoral fins
