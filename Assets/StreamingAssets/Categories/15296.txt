TAKE A DRIVE ON I-65
200|Well, it winds from I-N-D to A-L-A / Ending at this city that has its own bay|Mobile
400|Well, it goes through Indianapolis / Down to Columbus / This largest Kentucky city is oh so pretty|Louisville
600|Say a lot worse than "heck" / In the lousy bottleneck / Where I-40 meets 65 / In this country music hive|Nashville
800|You'll see Merrillville, Indiana & don't forget / This university in West Lafayette|Purdue
1000|Won't you get hip to this timely jive / & just south of this Great Lake arrive / At the north end of I-65|Lake Michigan
