POETRY ABOUT PROSE
200|1969 / Corleones are new / No horses were harmed / In making this clue|The Godfather
400|A tale of London / In times that were hard / Detailing the far north / & a shepherd-St. Bernard|The Call of the Wild
600|4 Kansas murders / Which led to conviction / In a new type of novel / That was somehow nonfiction|In Cold Blood
800|Doubles! they're doubles! / But they're thought quite insane / A royal mistake / Time to catch an old Twain|The Prince and the Pauper
1000|A disfigured guy / Falls for a woman in Paris, it's true / Sounds like it's "Hunchback" / But it's by a man named Leroux|The Phantom of the Opera
