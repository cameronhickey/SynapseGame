NFL OPENING WEEKEND
200|(Will Selva of the NFL Network presents the clue.) It's the play that starts the game, & since 2002, the name of the game that starts the NFL season; the first one was at the Meadowlands not quite a year after 9/11|kickoff
400|(Jason McCourty of the NFL Network presents the clue.) Quarterbacks, take note; don't start this season like Chicago's Jim Hardy did in 1950 when he threw a still-record 8 of these—maybe it was the wind|interceptions
600|(Kyle Brandt of the NFL Network presents the clue.) Wes Welker & Demaryius Thomas each caught two scores as part of this quarterback's monster 7-touchdown day against the Ravens in the 2013 opener|Peyton Manning
800|(Peter Schrager of the NFL Network presents the clue.) Those clichés about how "it's just one game" are true; in 1981, this team, led by Joe Montana & Bill Walsh, lost its first game to the Lions but ended up winning it all|the 49ers
1000|(Jamie Erdahl of the NFL Network presents the clue.) The Panthers' opening game in 2011 showed off the arm of this flashy dresser, as he passed for 422 yards, an NFL record for a player's first game|Cam Newton
