NOW LISTEN TO ME
200|I've removed the Flowmaster dBX, this part, from my car's exhaust system, & you're gonna hear me 3 blocks away|a muffler
400|I'm going to treat you to this kind of falsetto-&-back singing in the manner of a Tyrolean mountaineer|yodeling
600|Stand back! I'm gonna shred on my Telecaster, an electric guitar by this famed instrument maker|Fender
800|I'm snapping celery to make the sound of a breaking bone; I'm one of these movie sound "artists\"|a foley artist
1000|I'm whining—not in complaint but to imitate this insect of the genus Aedes|a mosquito
