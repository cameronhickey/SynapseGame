THE DC UNIVERSE WITH JAMES GUNN
200|(James Gunn presents the clue.) My new film, "Superman", is partly inspired by the comic book "All-Star Superman"; David Corenswet stars as the Man of Steel & Rachel Brosnahan plays this legendary reporter|Lois Lane
400|(James Gunn presents the clue.) I went online & searched "What's the dumbest DC character of all time?" & I found a character who first appeared in Detective Comics No. 300 named Polka-Dot Man; I love him so much that I made him part of my rogues' gallery in this 2021 movie|The Suicide Squad
600|(James Gunn presents the clue.) My brother Sean read a clue about being part of the sorry ragtag bunch called "The Protectors of the Universe" who helped out "The Revengers" or something like that; over here at DC, we have a different group of heroes, this one with the Green Lantern & Aquaman, who got their first series in 1960|the Justice League
800|(James Gunn presents the clue.) One of the coolest DC comic book characters co-created by Len Wein & further explored by Alan Moore is this green behemoth who came about in the Louisiana bayou|Swamp Thing
1000|(James Gunn presents the clue.) I had a blast writing "Creature Commandos", a series that features a Frankenstein character & launched a DC project with the same name as this 1998 movie about the director of "Frankenstein\"|Gods and Monsters
