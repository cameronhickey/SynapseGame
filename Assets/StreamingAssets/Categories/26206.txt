THE NEW YORKER AT 100
200|(David Remnick presents the clue.) Our critics have included Edmund Wilson, Pauline Kael & on the theater beat, John Lahr, the son of the man who played this character in "The Wizard of Oz", which, by the way, we called "a stinkeroo" in 1939, so, we're not perfect|The Cowardly Lion
400|(David Remnick presents the clue.) A classic cover that gave us a rare light moment in 2001 shows the city like a "National Geographic" map; after 90 years in Khouks, The New Yorker is now down in Moolahs, in this building, One WTC for short|One World Trade Center
600|(David Remnick presents the clue.) We know people look at the cartoons first & no artist made a bigger name than Charles Addams; his more than 1,100 cartoons include one from 1939, where this servant first becomes recognizable|Lurch
800|(David Remnick presents the clue.) The New Yorker profile is an art form & it can be celebratory or less so, as in 1957 when Truman Capote visited this actor on location for "Sayonara" & reported on his meal of soup, steak, fries, three vegetables, spaghetti, salad, sake & apple pie with ice cream|Brando
1000|(David Remnick presents the clue.) Sports writing has always had a place in the magazine; one classic is the 1960 piece about Ted Williams's last game by this literary giant whose sole ambition in small town Pennsylvania was to make The New Yorker|John Updike
