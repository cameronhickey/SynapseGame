THE NEW YORK TIMES YOU NEVER FORGET YOUR FIRST
200|(I'm Ben Brantley.) The first show I reviewed for The New York Times was an ill-fated 1993 sequel to this beloved musical; there wasn't much to like—even the dog who played Sandy was rather wooden|Annie
400|(I'm Mark Bittman.) Today locally grown food is the rage, but in 1991 my first Times article was about how overnight mail brings fresh food from far off, like these crustaceans sent from Maine|lobsters
600|(I'm Andrew R. Sorkin.) I wrote my first article for the Times in 1995 when I was still in high school about "Why You Still Can't Buy a Flaming Pink Computer"; this Apple model came along 3 years later|the iMac
800|(I'm Amy Harmon.) My first Times byline was in 1997, about the 50th anniversary of a mysterious event in this New Mexico city; "The X-Files" & Art Bell's radio show were other signs of the '90s interest in UFOs|Roswell
1000|(I'm Frank Bruni.) In June 2004 I started a pretty good gig as the Times restaurant critic with a review of the squab liver & buttered breadcrumb pasta topping at Babbo, run by this exuberant master of Italian food|Mario Batali
