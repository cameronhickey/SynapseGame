200|That spooky woman's head in a crystal ball always freaks me out on this scary ride|The Haunted Mansion
400|I'll feel like a kid again on this flying elephant ride, a fixture at Disneyland since 1955|Dumbo
600|I love the theme of global unity on the ride in which international dolls sing this interminable tune|\"It's A Small World\"
800|Aaargh! I can't wait to go on this classic ride now that Captain Jack Sparrow is part of the fun|Pirates of the Caribbean
1000|Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah! I can't wait to get soaked on this ride that has a 5-story plunge near the end|Splash Mountain
