AN ONOMATOPOEIA ROMANCE
200|When I see you, my beating heart does this, like the wings of a black swallowtail as it flies|flutter
400|Ah, yes, my dearest, I can't wait to say words of love to you as we "bill &" do this, like pigeons|coo
600|Darling, they're playing our song, this one by Charli XCX from "The Fault in Our Stars" soundtrack, & the beat goes on & on|\"Boom Clap\"
800|I desperately await this sound of you at the doorbell; it's the title of a Thoreau poem with "song" as one of the rhymes|\"Ding Dong\"
1000|When you ended things between us, it felt like this word that can precede "happy", with you as Moe & me as Larry|slap
