Unlike an internal combustion gas engine with many moving parts, a Tesla motor only has one, the rotor—as a result, this increase in velocity is instantaneous, allowing you to go from 0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds|acceleration
400|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew reports from Tesla Motors in Fremont, CA.) The body of each car begins with a giant 20,000-lb. coil of this metal, atomic #13, which will be stretched, bent, punched, painted & more before it's done|aluminum
600|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew reports from Tesla Motors in Fremont, CA.) As the body of a Tesla comes together, several joining methods are used, including adhesive, cold metal transfer, self-piercing rivets & the resistance type of this metallurgic technique|welding

1000|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from Tesla Motors in Fremont, CA.)
