RHYME THE TIME
200|To turn down that delicious glass of Burgundy|decline the wine
400|To have joint custody of a grizzly|share the bear
600|To surprise—nay, absolutely astound—a convent sister|stun the nun
800|To give up to another your foremost position in a race|cede the lead
1000|To abandon that scrumptious butterkuchen|forsake the cake
