SOUNDS LIKE THE MOVIE'S SEQUEL
200|This 1984 film based on a Frank Herbert novel was not a prequel to "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain\"|Dune
400|This 2009 comedy about a Vegas bachelor party was not the sequel to the Tom Cruise film "Cocktail\"|The Hangover
600|\"The Host", starring Saoirse Ronan, did not have this Korean import & Best Picture Oscar winner as its sequel|Parasite
800|In "Up", 78-year-old Carl flies away in his house; in this non-sequel George Clooney flies all over firing people|Up in the Air
1000|Sounds fitting, but "Singin' in the Rain" was not the first in a series with these "of Cherbourg\"|Umbrellas
