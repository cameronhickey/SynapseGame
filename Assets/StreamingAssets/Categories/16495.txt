ALASKAN WILDLIFE
200|(Sarah of the Clue Crew observes a bear at Pavlof Harbor in Alaska.) Despite their name, brown bears can have black or brown fur, & the brown bear here has a conspicuous shoulder hump & silver-tinted fur, which gives it this name, meaning "gray," not "gruesome\"|grizzly
400|(Sarah of the Clue Crew holds a crab at Lake Eva in Alaska.) In Alaska, only male Dungeness crabs are legal to catch; you know a male because of the triangular shape of this, the third major part of a crab's body, along with head & thorax|the abdomen
600|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from Glacier Bay in Alaska.) The straw-colored plumes that curve backwards from behind the eyes are part of the breeding ornamentation of the tufted variety of this auk family member|a puffin
800|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from Glacier Bay in Alaska.) With dense populations in coastal habitats, the murre is vulnerable to oil spoils; an estimated 185,000 murres were lost when this tanker spilled off Alaska in 1989|the Exxon Valdez
1000|(Sarah of the Clue Crew goes whale watching at Wachusett Cove in Alaska.) Humpbacks uniquely hunt using what's called a bubble net; the whales release a circle of bubbles under a school of fish, & as the air rises, a net forms, trapping the fish; the whales then swim up the net with open mouths, filtering food through these jawlike plates|baleen
