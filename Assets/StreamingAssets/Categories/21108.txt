SAY IT 3 TIMES
200|Start a song by singing this way to get your boat "gently down the stream\"|row, row, row
400|Say this triple-dipper that came near the end of Matthew McConaughey's Oscar acceptance speech|all right, all right, all right
600|Say the name of this "ghost with the most" 3 times & he'll show up to exorcise the living|Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
800|Say this cliche Lord Harold Samuel gave about the 3 most important things in real estate|location, location, location
1000|Say this noise that begins the lyrics of "The Trolley Song\"|clang, clang, clang
