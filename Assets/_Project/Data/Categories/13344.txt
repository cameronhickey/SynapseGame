ODE TO BILLY JOEL
200|Your first hit was this / '74 was the year / Say, does that microphone / Still smell like beer?|\"Piano Man\"
400|I recall this 2-word vid / That starred a young top model / The song was nice, but nicer still / Was watching Christie waddle|\"Uptown Girl\"
600|We saw your show with this man / But some of it's a blur / Loved that duet on "Your Song" / Hey, do you call him "Sir"?|Elton John
800|You sang to Virginia in this hit / Don't get mad & don't try to fix me / All I'm saying about it / Is that you just turned 60|\"Only The Good Die Young\"
1000|This album won a Grammy / & made you some real bones / Its title's a reminder / Some folks should not throw stones|Glass Houses
