THE IMPATIENT 19th CENTURY READER
200|Should've known I was in for the long haul when this novel began with an etymology section discussing "Cetus" & "Baleine\"|Moby-Dick
400|Did this author really need nearly 500 pages to work out the drama on Egdon Heath in "The Return of the Native"?|Thomas Hardy
600|Whew! Waded through 86 chapters of "Middlemarch" & I'm at the last section titled this, like the closing part of a symphony|Finale
800|Yes, I want to know how things work out for Jean Cosette in "Les Misérables", but a 19-chapter digression about this battle? C'mon!|Waterloo
1000|Been hooked on the "Varney the Vampyre" serial since 1845; it's 1847, & I'm ready for him to (spoiler!) jump into this Italian hotspot|Mount Vesuvius
