TENNIS TIPS
200|Doing this before serving can keep you loose, but don't imitate Novak Djokovic, who does it up to 25 times|bouncing the ball
400|Swing from low to high to hit this type of spin; some pros get 3,000 rpm on the ball|topspin
600|Getting close to the net gives you better angles on your volleys but leaves you vulnerable to this—look up!|a lob
800|(Kelly of the Clue Crew shows diagrams on the monitor.) Because the net is lower in the center & there's an extra 4 1/2 feet of court to work with, this type of diagonal shot is typically smarter than hitting it down the line|a cross-court
1000|Popularized by Evert, Connors & Borg, it's an easier stroke to learn but does limit your reach|the two-handed backhand
