COWBOY SONGS
200|The dying cowboy's companions ignored his request "Bury me not" here|On the lone prairie
400|This song good for line dancing contains the line "Fly's in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo\"|\"Skip To My Lou\"
600|They're the title sounds that spurs make as one goes "Riding merrily along\"|jingle, jangle, jingle
800|\"All day I face the barren waste without the taste of" this|Cool water
1000|In a famous song, an old cowboy sees these apparitions chasing a herd of red-eyed cows|ghost riders in the sky
