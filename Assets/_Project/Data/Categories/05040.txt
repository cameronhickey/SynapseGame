LOVE POETRY WITH JOHNNY GILBERT
200|We hope she meant the following for husband Robert: "I love thee to the level of every day's / Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light\"|Elizabeth Barrett Browning
400|It's the object John Donne is addressing here: "Why dost thou thus, / Through windows, and through curtains call on us? / Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?\"|Sun
600|With words like the following, this poet's name could be read as a statement: "So fair art thou, my bonnie lass, / So deep in luve am I; / And I will luve thee still, my dear, / Till a' the seas gang dry\"|Robert Burns
800|It's the line that precedes the following: "Thou art more lovely and more temperate. / Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May...\"|How do I compare thee to a summer's day?
1000|She wasn't so "saint"ly when she wrote the following: "What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, / I have forgotten, and what arms have lain / Under my head till morning\"|Edna St. Vincent Millay
