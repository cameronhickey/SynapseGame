WINTER SPORTS REVIEW
200|(Cheryl of the Clue Crew reads from a speed skating rink in Park City, UT.) It's the geometric name for a speed skating track; high altitude helps make the Utah Olympic one here the fastest ice on Earth|an oval
400|(Cheryl of the Clue Crew reads from Park City, UT.) Kufens, which steer the luge, are attached to these, also called steels|runners
600|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew lies prone with a rifle on a range in Park City, UT.) To be steady enough to fire accurately, a biathlete has to quickly bring this down from the 200s to the 160s|his heart rate
800|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew narrates a game being played on a rink in Park City, UT.) As well as speeding up the stone by reducing friction, sweeping reduces side-to-side movement, which logically is called this|the curl (curling accepted)
1000|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew crouches as he skis down a slope in Park City, UT.) Aerodynamically, this is the best position for shushing, or speeding straight down the hill|the tuck
