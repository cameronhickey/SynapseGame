MY DREAM HOUSE
200|In this style of pre-Revolutionary Americans, I like the Southern version with brick exterior & side chimneys|Colonial
400|I'll entertain royally with a house in this style named for a 19th c. queen, with its welcoming front porch|Victorian
600|This is it: the classic L shape & low-pitched gable roof of this house named for a Western dwelling|a ranch house
800|Why hold back—tower, stone, ornamentation, I want a home in the style of one of these French mansions|a château
1000|I'm going to use this smallish lot economically, putting up this kind of house with tiers only one half-story apart|a split-level
