USS COD
200|(Kelly of the Clue Crew bunks in the USS Cod in Cleveland, OH.) Living quarters on the Cod were cramped, with three crewmen taking turns sharing two bunks; the upper one I'm in, with extra headroom to accommodate the torpedo-loading hatch, was called this—a term for a top-floor, luxurious apartment|a penthouse
400|(Sarah of the Clue Crew shows off a torpedo tube on the USS Cod in Cleveland, OH.) Thanks to its torpedo data computer, the cod could fire guided weapons; a spindle slipped into the torpedo's side was used to set the course into an internal one of these spinning devices, from Greek for "circle watcher\"|a gyroscope
600|(Kelly of the Clue Crew stands topside on the USS Cod in Cleveland, OH.) On her last patrol, the Cod rescued the men of a Dutch submarine stranded on a mid-ocean reef; to keep the Dutch boat out of enemy hands, the crew used torpedoes & on-deck guns to do this, meaning to intentionally sink a friendly ship|to scuttle
800|(Kelly of the Clue Crew reports from inside the USS Cod in Cleveland, OH.) On May 10, 1944, the Cod fought its biggest battle; after engaging a convoy & sinking a destroyer, the crew stayed submerged for 12 hours in temperatures over 110 degrees, sweating out an attack by more than 70 of these underwater bombs|depth charges
1000|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from the deck of the USS Cod in Cleveland, OH.) The Cod's conning tower records her 47 combat victories—21 ships & 26 smaller vessels; most of them took place while on patrol in this sea, between the Philippines & Vietnam|the South China Sea
