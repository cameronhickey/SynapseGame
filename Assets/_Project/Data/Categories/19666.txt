NASCAR FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT
200|(I'm Joey Logano.) In 2015 I won my first Daytona 500 after some drama: a crash with 3 laps to go & then one of these—when the green flag waves & we hit the gas again|a restart
400|(I'm Matt Kenseth.) In 2000 I became the first rookie to win the Coca-Cola 600 & beat out this son of a legendary driver for Rookie of the Year honors|Dale Earnhardt Jr.
600|Smoke gets in the other drivers' eyes when this champion & team owner hits the track|Tony Stewart
800|(I'm Brad Keselowski.) In 2009 the first lap I ever led in a Sprint Cup race was the winning one at the Aaron's 499 in this city that's familiar to the fans of Ricky Bobby|Talladega
1000|(I'm Chase Elliott.) In 2016 I followed in the footsteps of this NASCAR legend by taking over behind the wheel of the 24 car when he retired from a cup career that began in 1992|Jeff Gordon
