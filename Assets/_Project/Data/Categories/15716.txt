I GOT TO FIRST BASE
200|Interference from the player in this position put me on first base—Posada, you fool!|the catcher
400|I took this route to first base, "BB" in your scorecard|a walk (or base on balls)
600|My teammate pulled a muscle rounding first after his single, so I went in as this|a pinch runner
800|I wish I could say I hit a line drive, but it was a popup; the fielder dropped it & was charged with this|an error
1000|As often happened with all-time leaders Craig Biggio & Ron Hunt, I crowded the plate & got on base this way|hit by a pitch
