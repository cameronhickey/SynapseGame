DUMB STUFF I SAW ON THE ROAD
200|A 1987 Accord (made by this company) said "four sale"; something tells me you can talk the seller down|Honda
400|A minivan bore a "Child in Car" sign, an obvious ripoff of this sign from Safety 1st Corp,; C'mon, spring for the original!|\"Baby on Board\"
600|A store had this word after "ATM", making it redundant; what a waste of money on that sign!|machine
800|A cinema marquee says "The Dark Night", leaving this letter off the Batman title; Seriously? No one notices this?|K
