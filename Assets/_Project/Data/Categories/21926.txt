THE PHYSICS OF TAEKWONDO
200|Practitioners create a solid foundation for striking & make it hard for an attacker to topple them by maintaining this stable 5-syllable state, from Latin for "balance\"|equilibrium
400|Flesh & bone breaks solid wood because the knife hand concentrates the impact on a small section of board, a vivid demonstration of the equation P equals F over A, pressure equals force divided by this measurement|area
600|Side kicks & other powerful blows are practiced on a heavy bag, taking advantage of its abundance of this physical property, the tendency of an object to remain at rest|inertia
800|A continuous series of spinning kicks moving in the same direction exploits this type of rotational momentum|angular momentum
1000|The axe kick swings in a downward arc, adding gravity to the blow & helping to increase this rotational force|torque
