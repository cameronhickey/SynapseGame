BAD POETRY ABOUT POETS
200|In 1890 she was 4 years dead / & her 1st book of poems was read / It was a big hit & such / For a lady who did not get out much|(Emily) Dickinson
400|His "Ode to Psyche" / Had some mad beats / But his love life, oh crikey! / Life was rough for...|(John) Keats
600|I wrote "Kubla Khan" / To give you the word / & did more stuff / Than just about that darned bird!|(Samuel) Coleridge
800|Nursing in the Civil War / Was unlike what I did before / I wrote of "my captain" Lincoln / O the tears back I was blinkin\'|(Walt) Whitman
1000|My big number is 600 / Somehow I rhymed it with "blunder'd" / As a rhyme, not very cool / But they teach my stuff in school!|Alfred Lord Tennyson
