800|(Jimmy gives the clue from Moto Restaurant in Chicago, IL.) Some creations at Moto involve the use of a laser; here, pastry chef Ben Roche uses one for this process; it heats sugar to the necessary 338 degrees quite efficiently|caramelization
1000|(Jimmy gives the clue from the Moto Restaurant in Chicago, IL.) Miracle berries expand the uses of foods like lemon by blocking the sour types of these specialized cells, which scientists now say are found all over and not in separate parts of the tongue|receptors
