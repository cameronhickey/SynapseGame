400|(Meryl Davis and Charlie White deliver the clue.) We were longtime fans of "Dancing With the Stars" before we competed on it; in fact, this "DWTS" pro and multiple winner of the show's Mirrorball trophy helped choreograph our short program for Sochi|Derek Hough

800|(Meryl Davis and Charlie White deliver the clue.) In 2014, we skated to music by a great Russian composer, Rimsky-Korsakov; we used this symphonic suite in which I assume the title role of a sultan's wife who spins stories to entertain her husband|\"Scheherazade\"
