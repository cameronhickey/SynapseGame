LEWIS & CLARK EXPEDITION
200|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew reports from St. Louis, MO.) Before beginning their expedition, Lewis & Clark waited in & around St. Louis for three months until they got word that this massive land transfer had been completed|the Louisiana Purchase
400|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from Ft. Abraham Lincoln in Mandan, ND.) The expedition spent their first winter with the Mandan Tribe here in North Dakota, where they met this Shoshone guide; "A woman with a party of men is a token of peace", Clark would later write|Sacagawea
600|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from Idaho along the banks of the Palouse River.) Lewis & Clark knew they'd be meeting tribal elders on their trip, so they took with them special peace medals that looked like this to give as gifts; one of the original medals issued by this president was found here along the Palouse River|Jefferson
800|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from Ft. Clatsop in Oregon.) Needing shelter for the winter of 1805-1806, Lewis & Clark built Ft. Clatsop, the first military structure west of the Rockies, & named it in honor of the local Clatsop Tribe, a branch of this Native American people whose name reflects a culture based on a type of salmon|the Chinook
1000|(Sarah of the Clue Crew reports from the Pacific shore in Oregon on a cold, windy day.) "Ocean in view! O! the joy!" Clark wrote, as their goal was in sight, probably on a day much like today; though they had failed to find the Northwest Passage, the expedition had learned much of the overland route & the course of this river, the largest to flow into the Pacific|the Columbia
