THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
200|(Kelly and Sarah of the Clue Crew hold a deflated weather balloon; Kelly reads the clue.) Weather balloons are released twice a day at the National Weather Service; they can rise up to 100,000 feet, where a decrease in this will make the 6-foot balloon expand to 20 feet in diameter|air pressure
400|(Sarah indicates a weather map on a monitor.) Colors on the screen reflect different echo intensities; steps are taken so this precipitation, balls of ice more than 1/5 inch in diameter, don't skew rain estimates|hail
600|(Sarah holds a weather balloon transmitter.) Pre-transmitters, scientists went up in weather balloons themselves; the AMS, this society, gives the Meisinger Award in memory of one killed by lightning|the American Meteorological Society
800|(Sarah indicates another monitor.) Watching Doppler the National Weather Service is fascinating—the expanding ring of blue is millions of these mammals that emerge in Texas only to tangle with a huge storm|bats
1000|(Kelly reads the clue.) Many tornadoes develop from a special kind of thunderstorm called this, with a deep rotating updraft|a supercell
