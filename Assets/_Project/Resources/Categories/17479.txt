WHAT'S YOUR SIGN, BABY?
200|You're impulsive! audacious! intemperate! & your glyph, said to represent ram's horns? nice!|Aries
400|\"The Astrology Encyclopedia" says you are "a moody sign... the source of the term crabby"—but that doesn't scare me!|Cancer
600|Such a dual nature! associated with Castor & Pollux, you're 2-faced, but I mean that in the best way!|Gemini
800|You're the 7th sign! Suave but liable to pout; romantic but fickle; it's like you try to balance everything!|Libra
1000|A St. Paddy's Day baby, you're the 12th & last sign of the zodiac, yet you're first in my heart|Pisces
