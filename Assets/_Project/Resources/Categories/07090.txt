MALTIN ON THE MOVIES
200|(Leonard Maltin starts things off.) I once wrote that only a real-life Grumpy could fail to love this 1937 animated feature|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
400|Steve Martin's first starring feature, Maltin describes it as "The misadventures of a terminally stupid man\"|The Jerk
600|(Leonard Maltin continues.) I've called this 1941 classic "A stunning film in every way" & Orson Welles was only 25 years old when he made it!|Citizen Kane
800|Maltin tells us this 1951 classic was "gorgeously filmed on location in the Belgian Congo\"|The African Queen
1000|(Leonard Maltin wraps up the category for us.) What Hitchcock did with this 1960 film was brilliant. Imagine, killing off your major star in the first portion of the film|Psycho
