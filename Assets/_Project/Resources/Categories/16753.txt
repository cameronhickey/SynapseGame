ALASKAN AQUATIC LIFE
200|(Sarah of the Clue Crew shows us a stream in Alaska.) As pink salmon near their spawning grounds, males develop hooked jaws & dorsal lumps that make them look more imposing to other males, which accounts for this whale-like nickname|humpbacks
400|(Sarah of the Clue Crew holds a sea star while scuba diving in Alaska.) Pacific sea stars lack developed eyes, but at the tip of each arm are eyespots that help distinguish light from dark with the help of these light-focusing structures found in human eyes|lenses
600|(Sarah of the Clue Crew scuba dives with an octopus in Alaska.) The giant Pacific octopus has a 24-foot armspan & two horn-like papillae above each eye, which some say give it this satanic fish nickname|devilfish
800|(Sarah of the Clue Crew shows us anemone shrimp underwater in Alaska.) Stinging tentacles don't bother the anemone shrimp because the shrimp has spent hours letting his host get accustomed to him so they can have the mutualistic this type of relationship, from the Greek for life|symbiotic
1000|(Sarah of the Clue Crew shows us a jellyfish swimming in Alaska.) Arctic Lion's Mane Jellyfish can be 120 feet long, impressive due to the fact they only live for about a year, most of its time in the fully developed stage named for this serpent headed Greek woman|Medusa
