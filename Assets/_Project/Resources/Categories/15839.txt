THE WINTER OF OUR DISCOUNT TENT
200|\"Winter-proof", hah! Our tent collected so much ice & snow, it resembled this Inuit dwelling aka an aputiak|an igloo
400|It took us hours to erect, & I hurt several of these lower-back vertebrae just below the thoracic|the lumbar (vertebrae)
600|Winds rushed in & Billy lost some frostbitten toes due to the "dry" type of this localized death of tissue|gangrene
800|It said "flame resistant", but a bit of this, aka paraffin oil, got on the tent & a spark lit it up like a Roman candle|kerosene
1000|The gaping holes in mother's tent let the ticks in, & now she's got this citric-sounding disease|lyme disease
