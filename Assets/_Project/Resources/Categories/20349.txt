EXPLORING THE WORLD
200|(Sven Lindblad gives the clue.) My first visit to Lindblad Cove, which was named after my father who in 1966 led the first tourist expedition to this continent, it moved me deeply with its beauty & family history|Antarctica
400|(Sven Lindblad gives the clue.) On some of the 50 trips I've made to these islands, my kids accompanied me; seeing them interact with the wildlife there illustrates the term "giant tortoise\"|the Galápagos Islands
600|(Sven Lindblad gives the clue.) Local fishermen have made areas where they used to fish off-limits in order to bolster the ecosystem making the diving experience off this Mexican peninsula the most spectacular I've ever had|Baja California
800|(Sven Lindblad gives the clue.) My journeys have taken me to Camp Leakey, a research facility which fights to rescue & protect the orangutan in its endangered habitat on this island shared by Indonesia, Malaysia & Brunei|Borneo
1000|(Sven Lindblad gives the clue.) The rule of thumb for explorers is to not approach wildlife too closely as they can become fearful & angry... but on a lucky day in this Scandinavian nation's Svalbard archipelago a small herd of walrus seemingly welcomed me|Norway
