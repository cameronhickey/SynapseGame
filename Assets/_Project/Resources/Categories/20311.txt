TIME FOR A DRINK
200|It's early, so I'll start with some O.J.—& champagne, this sparkling cocktail|a mimosa
400|I'm gonna party like it's 44 "B.C."! Mix me one of these, a Bloody Mary with clamato rather than tomato juice|a Bloody Caesar
600|Vodka, peach schnapps, cranberry & orange juices, quick! I need this, like Burt Lancaster & Deborah Kerr|Sex on the Beach
800|It'll have one of these pub concoctions, beer mixed with lemonade—& hold the Tristram|a shandy
1000|I see you have the traditional mug for it, so make me this, with lime juice, vodka and ginger beer|a Moscow Mule
