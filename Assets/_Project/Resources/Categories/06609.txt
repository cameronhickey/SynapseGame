CHRISTMAS RAPPINGS
200|A No. 1 hit in '52/ M.C. Trebek is tellin' you/ I don't remember dissin' him/ But "I saw mommy kissing" him|Santa Claus
400|I'm the reindeer kids adore/ Burl Ives told my tale in '64/ Got a nose that you can't miss/ Call it out, my name is this|Rudolph
600|He's green, he's mean/ A Christmas-stealing machine/ & that's not even worst of all/ It's that his heart's "2 sizes too small\"|the Grinch
800|Someone had to be his voice/ Jackie Vernon was the choice/ Jackie really nailed the role/ Of this "jolly happy soul\"|Frosty the Snowman
1000|He sang "Fame" but here's the thing/ He "pa rum pum pum pum"ed with (M.C.) Bing|David Bowie
