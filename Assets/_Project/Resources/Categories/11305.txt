ODE TO THE WEST WING
200|\'Twas 1909 when William Taft was first to haul / His bulk into thy hallowed space & see thy curving wall|Oval Office
400|The presence of the No. 2 man seems to cast a glow / within thy precincts, room with the initials V.P.O.|Vice President's Office
600|What man, what staff would dare hold conference / In thee, O room named for 2 presidents|Roosevelt Room
800|2006 brought renovation, only temporary / To thee, press briefing room named for a shot press secretary|James Brady
1000|Contentious meetings yield a mad cacophony / Within you, room with your grand table of mahogany|The Cabinet Room
