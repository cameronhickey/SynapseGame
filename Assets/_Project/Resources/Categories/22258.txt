STOP IT!
200|You can do this to your dog or your "enthusiasm\"|curb
400|To fire from a job, or to attempt to kill Sarah Connor, onscreen|terminate
600|To refuse to proceed, or a pitcher's faux pas|balk
800|Legally, sending a this & this letter notifies someone of their misconduct & orders them to cut it out, pronto|cease & desist
1000|To not say anything impulsively, or another word for a song's chorus|refrain
