400|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew stands in front of a piece of apparatus.) Massachusetts General is the only place where PET scanning & this imaging use one machine; the combination in 3-D images gives information faster in brain cancer patients, minimizing the time between detection & treatment|MRI
600|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew stands in front of another apparatus.) A device that uses microchips to detect one cancer cell in a billion may supersede this technique of taking tissue samples from living patients & may lead to finding cancers before tumors form|a biopsy
800|(Sarah of the Clue Crew is in front of another piece of apparatus.) Massachusetts General is one of the first hospitals to make genetic testing standard in cancer treatment; robotics allow the processing of up to 96 samples at once, so doctors can immediately target patients with these changes in DNA sequence|mutations
1000|(Sarah of the Clue Crew stands before another apparatus.) To spare healthy tissues while treating tumors, Massachusetts General uses a state-of-the-art cyclotron to deliver radiation; beams of these particles, hydrogen atoms whose electrons have been removed|protons
