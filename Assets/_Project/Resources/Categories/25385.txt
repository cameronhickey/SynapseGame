ACTUALLY, THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO
200|Who knew? These on footwear have dulled rowels designed not to puncture the animal's skin|spurs
400|I realized bluffing didn't get you too far in the event called cowboy this, in which a bull helps players know when to fold 'em|poker
600|No joke, bullfighter (not that kind) is another name for this rodeo performer who helps out when a rider hits the dirt|rodeo clown
800|I thought it would be longer, but a male rider only has to stay on a bronc this long to get a score in a rough stock event|8 seconds
1000|What better way to start off than a trip to this Alberta city's Stampede that's been a-hootin' & a-hollerin' since 1912|Calgary
