REAL REVIEWS OF THE NOVEL
200|Its author shouldn't "waste his strength on such purposeless and unequal doings as these rambling volumes about spermaceti whales\"|Moby-Dick
400|H.L. Mencken: The "clown Fitzgerald rushes to his death in nine short chapters... this story is obviously unimportant\"|The Great Gatsby
600|\"Characterization in general is weak... nor is the commander strongly drawn. Again, the aunts are best... it lacks imagination\"|The Handmaid's Tale
800|Oh, Heathcliff! "The only consolation which we have in reflecting upon" this Bronte work "is that it will never be generally read\"|Wuthering Heights
1000|\"The trial and the melodramatic conclusion" of this "seem contrived. But (the) insight into Southern mores is impressive\"|To Kill a Mockingbird
