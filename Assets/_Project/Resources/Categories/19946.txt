A SONG OF "YOU\"
200|This "shining" 1973 No. 1 by Stevie Wonder forever will stay in our hearts|\"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\"
400|Say this alternate title of a 2010 Cee Lo Green hit & you can remain on our stage|\"Forget You\"
600|After 2 billion YouTube views, we'd add "& Again" to this song by Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Puth|\"See You Again\"
800|In this 2006 hit The Killers said you could "close your eyes & see the place where you used to live\"|\"When You Were Young\"
1000|The lady's response to this title query in a 1982 Human League hit? No, pretty much|\"Don't You Want Me\"
