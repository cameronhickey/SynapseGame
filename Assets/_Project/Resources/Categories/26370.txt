ODE ON A GRECIAN
200|For he oft waxed philosophical / But not much in making serum / Ionia-born, 'tis he we mourn! / For he gave us his big theorem|Pythagoras
400|She walks in beauty / Praised Aphrodite / Ancient lit's sweet siren / To sing this poetess' praise / We had to steal from Byron|Sappho
600|The master who was Sophocles / Left us lovely plays / Like him "the king" / A wondrous thing / But that family? Yeesh, better days|Oedipus
800|\"A line is a length without breadth" / Truly a statement worthwhile! / with axioms & postulates / His "Elements" had style|Euclid
1000|Reason desires truth / "The Republic", ne'er forgot / A tome that stands the test of time / That this author, sadly, could not|Plato
