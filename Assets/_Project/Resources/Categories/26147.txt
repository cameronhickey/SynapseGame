DARLING, YOU SPOKE FRENCH
200|You told me you'd love me to your dernier souffle, not your last puffed egg dish but your last this|(your last) breath
400|I swoon when you describe the clair de lune, this, shimmering on the water|the moonlight
600|I'm glad you adore my sourire, this, also the title in Quebec of a horror movie with Sosie Bacon|a smile
800|When you quote "La Vie en rose" with "Des nuits d'amour à plus finir", these "never to end"... dim the lights|nights of love
1000|Ma chère, you made me the happiest man on Earth when you said "oui" at the sight of this, une bague de fiancailles|an engagement ring
