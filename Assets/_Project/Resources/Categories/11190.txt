I PLAY THE DRUMS!
200|(Jon of the Clue Crew delivers the clue from the drummer's throne.) A common rock & roll pattern is this one which stresses the 2nd & 4th beat; it's also the title of a movie about The Beatles|backbeat
400|(Jon of the Clue Crew peers down between the cymbals.) Playing triplets—three strokes for every two notes—was a trademark of this late Led Zeppellin drummer|John Bonham
600|(Jon of the Clue Crew sticks with his drums—& drums with his sticks.) Playing this gives me an explosive sound on the snare drum; to help out a comedian's lame joke combine it with a cymbal crash|a rimshot
800|(Jon of the Clue Crew subs on the drum set.) After you get into a groove, now & again throw in this; as the name suggests, it's for when there's an empty space in the music|a fill
1000|(Jon of the Clue Crew delivers the final clue of the category.) It's the rhyming phrase for a steady rhythm that hits the bass drum on each quarter note|four-on-the-floor
