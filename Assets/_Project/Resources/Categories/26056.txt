KING ARTHUR'S VERY PUNNY KNIGHTS
200|This knight was so plump his belly was equal to pi times his diameter|Sir Cumference
400|He told everyone of his skills for when Britain became even more anarchic, like finding food & shelter & making fires in the wild|Sir Vivalist
600|For a boundary dispute with a rival king, King Arthur called on this knight equipped to settle the issue|Sir Veyor
800|This knight had rhythm! Though sadly more to do with 24-hour time periods than with music|Sir Cadian
1000|He always took the kind of route named for him—6 hours of twists & turns for what should be a 2-hour ride back to Camelot|Sir Pentine (Sir Cuitous)
