HELL'S KITCHEN, THE MUSICAL
200|(Alicia Keys presents the clue.) Practically a character itself, the setting of much of the show is Manhattan Plaza, the real-life building where I grew up among many artists hoping to make it, just a block east to Eighth Ave., the edge of this district|the Theater District
400|(Alicia Keys presents the clue.) In Hell's Kitchen, you don't need a Steinway or a Stradi to make music; Ali's love interest plays drums on buckets, & she joins in for this song that says, "She's a flame" "You can try, but you'll never forget her name, she's on top of the world, hottest of the hottest girls say, oh-oh\"|\"Girl On Fire\"
600|(Alicia Keys presents the clue.) "Kaleido-leido-leido-leido-leidoscope, everyone looking high and low" A new song about opening up the world, "Kaleidoscope" was the theme song of this sporting event in 2024, & in late August, Shoshana Bean made the trip from Hell's Kitchen to Queens to sing at the opening night|U.S. Open of tennis
800|(Alicia Keys presents the clue.) Along with new songs, the show reimagines some of my classics, like this breakout hit from 2001, about a love that's so much pleasure & so much pain; it has new instrumentation & a new seductive tone, & is sung by a dude "Lovin' you darlin, makes me so confused\"|\"Fallin'\"
1000|(Alicia Keys presents the clue.) "New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of (oh, come on), there's nothin' you can't do" The closing number's this song that I performed on the Tony Awards in 2024, with of course, a guest vocal by Jay-Z|\"Empire State of Mind\"
