HOW IT'S DONE
200|Back up, turning toward the curb; when your front door reaches the bumper of the car beside you, turn the other way|parallel parking
400|Ovulate, add albumen, then shell, & pass from body— or tell a bad joke|to lay an egg
600|With your right hand, touch your forehead, base of the sternum, left & right shoulder; think of the Trinity|to make the sign of the Cross
800|Note the dial numbers, left to right; subtract the previous figure to get kilowatt-hours used|to read your electric meter
1000|Pile up garbage & lawn clippings at least 3' x 3'; let sit a few months, turning every 4-6 weeks, before using|composting
