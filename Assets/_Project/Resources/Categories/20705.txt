OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
200|Differing by 2 days, the sidereal & synodic types of these are determined by the Moon|periods (or months)
400|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew presents the clue.) Asteroid 2010, TK7, flew into an area that normally would cause it to orbit unstably, but it hit just the right spot where gravity holds it steady in Earth's orbit, making it this type of asteroid that shares its name with an ancient Greek war|a Trojan
600|This very hot planet sorta has snow—metals like galena are vaporized & settle as mist on the mountains|Venus
800|(Sarah of the Clue Crew presents the clue.) Uranus' severe tilt & 84-year orbit mean that the decades-long seasons are extreme; most of the time, one-half is in total darkness or light, but during this 2007 event, every part of the planet saw some sunlight|the autumnal equinox
1000|This big moon of Saturn has rain & lakes; don't get excited—they are made of methane|Titan
