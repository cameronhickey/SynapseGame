I GOT THEM HISTORICAL BLUES
200|On the day I was born / In April 1822 / I had no idea I'd be president, or a top general too / I wore the blues / The Union Army blues|(Ulysses) Grant
400|Can you hear this train's whistle blowin' / In 1889 / Running from Paris to Constantinople / Murder on the riders' minds|the Orient Express
600|There's a dark house over yonder / In Boston's North Square / The home this Founding Father rode from / A home still standing there|Paul Revere
800|Goin' to this max-security prison / Goin' to N.Y. soon / Its prisoner revolt had Pacino scream it / In "Dog Day Afternoon\"|Attica
1000|Hundreds of miles of this barrier / Got to stop any German assault / Got a design but no Belgian line / Think that may be a fault|Maginot
