IDEAS FOR TOURISM CAMPAIGNS
200|We're mostly 4,000 feet above sea level & Idi Amin doesn't run us anymore. Isn't that enough?|Uganda
400|Keflavik & Grindavik call to you, & we'll throw in a 50/50 shot at seeing Bjork somewhere|Iceland
600|Our Andes are dandy! Only Brazil has more people in South America, but they don't have our coffee. Hail...|Colombia
800|From Koluszki to Kolno, & Wozniki to Strzelce, visit us, but just know we've heard all the jokes already|Poland
1000|We're one big island! (& several small ones); Lemur entertain you! (Disclaimer: Lemurs will not, repeat not, speak to you)|Madagascar
