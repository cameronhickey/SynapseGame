FINISH THE CLASSIC AMERICAN LYRIC
200|\"Home, home on the range, where" these play|the deer and the antelope
400|\"O beautiful for spacious skies...\"|for amber waves of grain
600|\"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when...\"|skies are gray
800|\"Doe, a deer, a female deer; ray, a drop of golden sun; me...\"|a name I call myself
1000|\"Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine...\"|you are lost and gone forever, oh my darling Clementine
