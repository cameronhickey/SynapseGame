NOT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR JAZZ
200|Not quite—this pianist's name isn't Felonious Funk|Thelonious Monk
400|Brother of Branford, this trumpet legend doesn't go by Clinton, but by this name|Wynton Marsalis
600|It's not Stan Lee or Stan Musial, it's this cool school sax man|Stan Getz
800|Close, but despite the sweetness of his guitar, this Belgian-born Gypsy wasn't known as Mango Seinfeld|Django Reinhardt
1000|So close—Benny Goodman's percussive prince wasn't Dean Cooper but rather this|Gene Krupa
