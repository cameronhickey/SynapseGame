COMIC INFLUENCES
200|(I'm Patton Oswalt.) In high school I couldn't get enough of this comedy troupe who had it all—SPAM, the Spanish Inquisition, a dead parrot, the dirty fork—nudge, nudge, wink, wink; know what I mean, say no more|Monty Python
400|(I'm Ego Nwodim.) Comedy heroes of mine include fellow "Saturday Night Live" stars Maya Rudolph, Amy Poehler & this woman who became the show's first female head writer in 1999|Tina Fey
600|(I'm Iliza Shlesinger.) I remember begging for "Wayne's World" on VHS and have said that this performer is an American comedy staple despite being Canadian|Mike Myers
800|(I'm Ray Romano.) When we did "Everybody Loves Raymond" this legend was a huge influence; as sitcoms can be, hers was hilarious & at times broad, but her style was always real & that's what we tried to emulate|Mary Tyler Moore
1000|(I'm Aisha Tyler.) In college I decided to make comedy my career after seeing this deadpan comic who once noted, "It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to paint it.\"|(Steven) Wright
