AND THE PITCH
200|In 2006 the Tigers' Joel Zumaya threw this pitch 104.8 mph, so it lived up to its name|a fastball
400|Aka the drooler, this pitch was banned in 1920 except for 17 hurlers who got to use it until they retired|a spitball
600|(Jimmy of the Clue Crew presents by a display monitor.) A left-handed pitcher's curveball breaks downward and to the catcher's left. In the 1930's Carl Hubbell was a master of this kooky pitch that did the opposite, breaking right|a screwball
800|Few hitters feast on this breaking pitch like the burger of the same name; Ted Williams said it was "the greatest pitch in baseball\"|the slider
1000|Check out the grip and you can see why the circle type of this off-speed pitch got its name|the change-up
